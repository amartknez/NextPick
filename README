# Next Pick  
*A Smart Recommendation System for Movies, Books, and Media*

---

## Overview
**Next Pick** is a collaborative project designed to help users discover new movies, books, and other related media through personalized recommendations.  
Using datasets from sources like **IMDB** and **Goodreads**, the system aims to provide accurate, scalable, and user-friendly suggestions.

This project is being developed as part of a team effort following an **agile methodology**. Each sprint focuses on building and refining different parts of the system — from data pipelines and recommendation algorithms to UI and deployment.

---

## Team Roles
- **Project Lead / Documentation:** Oversees project progress, maintains documentation, and manages task tracking.  
- **Data Engineer:** Handles data collection, cleaning, and schema design.  
- **Recommendation Algorithm Engineer:** Develops and tests recommendation approaches.  
- **Frontend Developer / UI:** Designs and implements the user interface.  
- **Testing & Deployment Engineer:** Establishes testing pipelines and deployment strategies.

## Functional Requirements
### **Data Management**
- Ingest datasets from IMDB and Goodreads.  
- Clean and preprocess data for consistency.  
- Store data in a structured format following the designed schema.

### **Recommendation Engine**
- Implement algorithms such as content-based, collaborative filtering, or hybrid methods.  
- Provide personalized recommendations based on user profiles or item similarities.  
- Support scalability for new recommendation strategies.

### **Frontend / UI**
- Present recommendations through a simple, intuitive interface.  
- Allow users to search for media and view results interactively.  
- Include mockups or skeleton screens in early development.

### **Testing & Deployment**
- Establish a testing framework for validating system components.  
- Automate unit tests for algorithms and data pipelines.  
- Define and document deployment processes.

### **Documentation & Project Management**
- Maintain a GitHub repository with proper README and documentation.  
- Track tasks and progress using a project board.  
- Keep requirements and design documents up to date.

## Non-Functional Requirements
### **Performance**
- Recommendation queries should return within a few seconds.  
- System should handle large datasets efficiently.  

### **Usability**
- UI should be clean, accessible, and easy to navigate.  
- Recommendations should be easy to interpret for end-users.  

### **Reliability**
- Handle missing or inconsistent data gracefully.  
- Ensure consistent and accurate results across runs.  

### **Maintainability**
- Use modular, well-documented code.  
- Update documentation as development progresses.  

### **Portability**
- Deployable across different environments (local and cloud).  

---

## Constraints
- Dataset access depends on availability of public/open APIs or files.  
- Project must be completed within sprint timelines.  
- Must use open-source frameworks and tools.

---

## Deliverables
- Cleaned datasets and schema design.  
- Prototype recommendation algorithm.  
- UI mockups and working skeleton.  
- Testing framework and deployment plan.  
- Project documentation (requirements, design, and final README).
